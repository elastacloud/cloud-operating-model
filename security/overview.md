# Securing your Cloud environment

A key part of being able to operate securely in the Cloud is understanding your business requirements. Having this understanding not only helps your choose an appropriate Cloud provider but also helps your teams build and delivery the right solutions, avoiding solutions where you just *"throw everything in"*. This last part is also crucial in terms of your operating model, knowing what data you will be storing will help you determine the levels of security to apply. For instance, you wouldn't necessarily apply the same level of control to publicly accessible data as you would to data which is subject to Data Protection laws.

Ongoing monitoring and checking of the environment plays a key role. If left to the very end of a project you will often find yourself in a situation where deadlines are missed because of re-work, or you have to "make do" with what has been delivered because your either out of time, budget or both. Ensuring that you have the capability to monitor and operate the environment you're delivering to provides you with the opportunity to identify issues early and resolve them quickly. Gaining knowledge of the system early also helps when providing early life support for your systems as your operational team have already been exposed to the solution they're supporting.
